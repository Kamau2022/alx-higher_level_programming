##0.To import a simple function from a simple file

A program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

    We shall use print function with string format to display integers

    we shall assign:

        the value 1 to a variable called a

        the value 2 to a variable called b

    and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
    a and b will be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2

    This program will print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line.
    The word add_0 is used once in this code
